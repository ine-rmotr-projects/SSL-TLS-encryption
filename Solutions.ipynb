On Mac OSX, the (Homebrew installer)[https://brew.sh/] provides similar capabilities to `apt-get`, `dnf`, or `zypper`.  On Windows installation is more difficult, but some binaries have been packaged at https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries.  Building from source code on Windows is more secure, if you are able to (it's not difficult, but you will need a compiler toolchain).\n",
